# NeetCode Interview Preparation Roadmap

Welcome to your structured DSA learning journey! This folder contains a complete roadmap based on NeetCode's 150 essential problems, organized by patterns and topics.

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

- **Learn by imaging and coding**: Visualize the problem, understand the pattern, then code
- **Bit by bit**: Master each concept before moving to the next
- **Pattern-based**: Focus on recognizing and applying algorithmic patterns
- **Interview-ready**: Build skills for FAANG-level technical interviews

## 📚 The 17 Core Topics

### Beginner Level (Start Here!)
1. **Arrays & Hashing** - Efficient manipulation and lookup
2. **Two Pointers** - Optimized algorithms for arrays/strings
3. **Sliding Window** - Processing continuous subarrays
4. **Stack** - LIFO structures and problem-solving

### Intermediate Level
5. **Binary Search** - Searching in sorted data
6. **Linked List** - Node manipulation
7. **Trees** - Binary trees, BSTs, traversals
8. **Heap / Priority Queue** - Optimized data retrieval
9. **Backtracking** - Recursive search approaches
10. **Tries** - Prefix-based structures

### Advanced Level
11. **Graphs** - Graph traversals and algorithms
12. **Intervals** - Overlapping interval problems
13. **Greedy** - Optimal step-by-step selection
14. **1D Dynamic Programming** - Memoization & tabulation
15. **2D Dynamic Programming** - Advanced DP
16. **Bit Manipulation** - Bitwise operations
17. **Math & Geometry** - Mathematical reasoning

## 📅 Recommended Study Plan

### Option 1: Steady Pace (7 weeks)
- **2-3 hours/day**
- ~2-3 problems per day
- Complete 1 topic every 3-4 days

### Option 2: Moderate Pace (4 weeks)
- **4-6 hours/day**
- ~4-5 problems per day
- Complete 1 topic every 2 days

### Option 3: Intensive (3 weeks)
- **8-10 hours/day**
- ~7-8 problems per day
- Complete 1 topic daily

## 🎓 How to Use This Roadmap

### For Each Topic:

1. **Read the `GUIDE.md`** - Understand the pattern and when to use it
2. **Study the `template.py`** - Learn the code pattern skeleton
3. **Visualize** - Use the visualization examples to "see" the algorithm
4. **Solve Easy problems first** - Build confidence
5. **Progress to Medium/Hard** - Challenge yourself
6. **Review and reflect** - Understand why the pattern works

### File Structure in Each Topic:
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Don't rush** - Understanding > Speed
2. **Write code by hand first** - Helps with visualization
3. **Explain out loud** - If you can teach it, you know it
4. **Practice pattern recognition** - "I've seen this before!"
5. **Review regularly** - Spaced repetition is key
6. **Time yourself** - Build interview-speed coding skills
