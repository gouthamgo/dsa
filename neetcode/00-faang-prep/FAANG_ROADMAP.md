## 🎯 Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: "I'm stuck at Medium problems"
```
Solutions:
1. Focus on one pattern at a time (don't jump around)
2. Do 10-15 problems of SAME pattern before moving on
3. Review solutions before attempting (learn patterns first)
4. Practice explaining your approach out loud
5. Use hints after 15 min (don't waste hours stuck)
```

### Problem: "Running out of time in interviews"
```
Solutions:
1. Practice with timer ALWAYS
2. Spend more time on approach (less on coding)
3. Use templates for common patterns
4. Type faster (practice typing speed)
5. Skip optimal solution if not coming, start with brute force
```

### Problem: "Forgetting patterns/solutions"
```
Solutions:
1. Use spaced repetition (REVISION_SYSTEM.md)
2. Create pattern cheat sheet
3. Review problems weekly
4. Teach patterns to others (deepens understanding)
5. Focus on "why" not just "how"
```

### Problem: "Failing behavioral rounds"
```
Solutions:
1. Record yourself telling stories
2. Quantify ALL results (numbers, percentages)
3. Focus more on YOUR actions (less "we")
4. Practice with mock interviews
5. Research company culture better
```

### Problem: "Not getting interviews"
```
Solutions:
1. Fix resume (get professional review)
