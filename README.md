## 💡 Core Learning Philosophy

### 1. Pattern Recognition > Memorization
```
❌ Don't memorize: "This is how you solve Two Sum"
✅ Do recognize: "Oh, finding a pair? That's Hash Map!"
```

### 2. Visual Thinking
```
Always draw:
[1, 2, 3, 4]
 ↑     ↑
left  right

Trees:   1
        / \
       2   3
```

### 3. Think → Code → Learn
```
1. Solve by hand first (imaging!)
2. Identify the pattern
3. Code it (bit by bit)
4. Understand why it works
```
